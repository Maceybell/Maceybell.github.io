        <div class = "about-text">I got interested in software for the lifestyle but now, while I still code to live, I also live to code. My five years of sales and management experience help me understand what users want and need, and developing software is a refreshing way of manufacturing satisfying experiences for others. But I am definitely still finding time for my snowboard, my steam account, the sauna, and watching Chainsaw Man.
